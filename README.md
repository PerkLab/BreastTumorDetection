# BreastTumorDetection
## Project Goals 
- Use deep learning to detect breast tumor region in breast ultrasound images
- Create bounding convex hull around tumor 
- Use detected tumor region as initial guess of tumor contour for lumpNav guidelet 
## Data 
- Collected from the 2016 non-palpable lumpectomy study 
- 40 cases 
- bmod ultrasound images of tumor in a sequence
- 3D contour of tumor region
- intersection of tumor region contour and ultrasound images from electromagnetic tracking data
